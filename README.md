# BGS-Earthquakes

A Service Now custom application that pulls the UK Recent Earthquake data from (https://earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/feeds/feeds.html) using the REST API in Flow Designer, it then uses the XML parser to import the data into a custom table.

The application includes two reports (both maps), on that displays information relating to any UK Earthquakes in the past 24 hours and the second shows all UK Earthquakes since the 19th August 2020 (oldest data available when I wrote the application).

This application was written for my own use, as a real life example to allow me to better understand Service Now Studio and Flow Designer.
